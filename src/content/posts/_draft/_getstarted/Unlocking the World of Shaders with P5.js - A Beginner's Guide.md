## Introduction: The Mystical World of Shaders

In the realm of digital art and game development, shaders are often mentioned with a mix of awe and mystery. But what exactly are shaders, and how can one approach them, especially using a friendly tool like P5.js? This blog aims to demystify shaders and provide a roadmap for beginners eager to explore this fascinating aspect of creative coding.

## Understanding Shaders: The Basics

### Shaders: The Digital Paintbrush

Shaders are small programs written in a specific shading language, such as GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). They run on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and determine how pixels on the screen are rendered. In simple terms, shaders are the tools that tell your computer how to display graphics, creating effects ranging from simple color changes to complex motion graphics.

## Approaching Shaders with P5.js

### Why P5.js?
P5.js, a JavaScript library, is an excellent gateway into the world of shaders. It's designed for artists and beginners, making it more accessible than other programming environments. P5.js simplifies the implementation of shaders, allowing you to focus on creativity rather than getting bogged down by technical details.

There are other library such as pixi.js which capable of handling shaders, but it geared towards developers well-versed in programming, offering a fast and flexible 2D WebGL renderer suitable for developing rich, interactive graphics and games.
## Key Concepts in Shaders

### 1. Vertex and Fragment Shaders
- **Vertex Shaders:** Determine the position of vertices in 3D space.
- **Fragment Shaders:** Also known as pixel shaders, they define the color, texture, and depth of pixels.
### 2. GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)
The programming language used to write shaders, offering a wide range of functions for mathematical and graphical operations.
### 3. Uniforms, Varyings, and Attributes
These are types of variables in GLSL, each serving different purposes in shader programming.

## A Glossary for the Shader Novice

1. **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** 
   Hardware that executes rendering, calculation, and processing of graphics.
2. **Rendering:** 
   The process of generating an image from a model using computer programs.
3. **Texture:** 
   A bitmap image applied to the surface in 3D graphics.
4. **Coordinate System:** 
   The system in GLSL that helps in positioning and transforming vertices.
5. **Fragment:** 
   A term used in fragment shaders, referring to the data needed to render a single pixel.
6. **WebGL:** 
   A JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.

## Practical Steps to Start with Shaders in P5.js

1. **Setup P5.js Environment:** 
   Ensure you have the P5.js library set up in your coding environment.
2. **Understand Basic Shapes and Colors:** 
   Start with simple P5.js sketches to get a feel for drawing and coloring.
3. **Introduction to GLSL:** 
   Learn the basics of GLSL, focusing on syntax and basic constructs.
4. **Experiment with Simple Shaders:** 
   Start by creating simple fragment shaders to change colors or textures.
5. **Progress to More Complex Shaders:** 
   Gradually move to more complex shaders involving lighting, texture mapping, and other effects.
6. **Explore and Experiment:** 
   The key to mastering shaders is experimentation. Play around with code, break things, and learn from your mistakes.

## Next: Your Journey into Shaders Begins

Shaders are a blend of art and science, requiring both creative vision and technical skills. With P5.js, you have a user-friendly tool at your fingertips to start this exciting journey. Remember, the world of shaders is vast and complex, but with patience and practice, you can unlock its full potential.
