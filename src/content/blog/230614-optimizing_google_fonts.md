Google Fonts is an amazing resource that many web developers rely on for their projects. However, there are speed and security issues associated with using Google Fonts directly. In this post, we will explore these issues and provide a solution on how to write your own custom font-face declaration for better performance and security.

## The Problem with Google Fonts
The convenience of Google Fonts comes with two main issues:

1. **Speed**

    When you use Google Fonts, you are not optimizing the speed at which your fonts load. This can affect the performance of your website, especially if you are using multiple fonts.

2. **Privacy and Security**

    Google Fonts has faced legal challenges due to privacy and security concerns. Using Google Fonts requires you to comply with certain legal requirements, which can be a hassle.

## The Solution: Custom Font-Face Declaration
To address these issues, you can set up your own font-face that you load up for users. This process involves downloading a font, declaring a font-face, and then using the font in your CSS. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Download a Font**

    You can download a font from a site like Font Share, which offers free fonts. Make sure to download different versions of the font (e.g., regular, bold, italic) in various formats (e.g., woff2, woff, ttf) for maximum compatibility.

2. **Declare a Font-Face**
  
    In your CSS, you can declare a font-face. This involves specifying the font family name, the source (src) of the font files, the font style, and the font weight. You can also provide a list of sources as a fallback stack, starting with the most preferred format.

3. **Use the Font**
  
    Once you've declared the font-face, you can use the font in your CSS by specifying the font family.

## Enhancing the Solution: Local Fonts and Variable Fonts
You can further enhance this solution in two ways:

1. **Local Fonts**

    You can declare a local font file so that the browser will use whatever's on the user's system first and then only default to what you're uploading if they don't have it on their system. This can significantly improve the speed at which your fonts load.

2. **Variable Fonts**

    Variable fonts are a more modern way to use fonts. They allow you to use a single font file for multiple variations, which can reduce the number of fonts that need to be downloaded.

## Conclusion

While Google Fonts is a convenient resource, it's not always the best solution for every project. By setting up your own font-face, you can improve the speed and security of your website. Plus, you can provide a better user experience by using local fonts and variable fonts.
