# logs
230602 - move all experiment to stackblitz; now this project will only focus on blog & portfolio
230531 - pulled subscribed youtube channel data, ready for filter and organize
230518 - move all sketches to p5js to editor.p5js.org; 
230507 - yt-video on programmer standards, malaysia as financial hub, crashcourse study skill
  - [x] [230506| Responsive Navbar HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - YouTube.url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63sxOYm9GwY)
  - [x] [180517| Return to Top Arrow.url](http://codepen.io/rdallaire/pen/apoyx)
230506 - trim all bootstrap templates, too much bloat and all .scss moved to /bootstrap; all component to be underscored (_); KEEP ALL ASSETS WITHIN IT OWN FOLDER, cross-usage causes hard updates
  - [x] wp-block - created a simple block for /yayasan project, yet to utilize in production
  - [x] wpbase template - created a parent-theme for wordpress
  - [x] bash (230426-slowly learning by using it; use for starting local-dev, shutdown windows, download via yt-dlp, OCR to read text from screenshots)
230426 - on yt-dlp.sh, written a functions to extract youtube-transcript into clipboard, frictionless copy/paste into chatgpt for quick youtube summary
230424| found and implemented Tesseract OCR for easy text extraction from screenshot images (see func.sh); 
230418 - moves all P5js sketches to online editor; only keep "Permanent" sketches here
230401 - reformatted T480; win11 feels a little off...
230328 - implemented openai api: text completion & image generation via vuejs
230323 - reorganized pages into 4 months, making it be more manageable; simplified blog's styling and component, also redo /blog components due to mistake, lesson learnt
230313 - added grain effect to the website, pretty cool stuff with 'mix-blend-mode'
230309 - KISS from explore.astro to explore.md; learnt to pull single .md contents; balls deep into astrojs, so damn good!
230308 - experimented with Hyperplexed tutorials, successfully went thru 3 short/simple tutorials
230306 - added example of shufflejs and masonaryjs; add canvas/controller class to p5
230303 - added content collection for blogposts
230228 - mdx cannot be parse; keep it simple with dedicated LayoutSingle.astro instead of using Layout.astro + props
230228 - Use Layout without LayoutSingle works well to duplicate/modify the template
230228 - Reorganize blog-astro-project; figured out using 1 Layout, simple nests to KISS, does not rely on codes to tag/organize the contents; may want to use alias next, also use url_pathname as date & title (try place it into meta-title)
230226 - moved /exp items into /blog; all-in-one project moving forward
230115 - trimmed the the fats on VueRouter/Layout/navItems; added bootstrap5 and tailwindcss
